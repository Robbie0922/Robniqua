      <h3>"Attention Span"</h3>
      What that mind do?<br>
      What's your attention span like?<br>
      Can I turn you on to some poetry?<br>
      Can you pick my words apart when you listen to me?<br>
      Or do I have to repeat myself multiple times<br>
      for you to hear what's on my mind?<br>
      <br>
      What that spirit do?<br>
      What are your chakras like?<br>
      Can you turn me on to some yoga?<br>
      Cause I'm into that, but never got the time.<br>
      If I like you I'll make the time.<br>
      I'm tryna get to know you,<br>
      better yet get inside ya mind.<br>
      <br>
      I'm tryna see what that attention span is like.<br>
      When I lay with you at night.<br>
      Would you understand the lesson after an argument or fight.<br>
      Do you lack communication?<br>
      Are you always on your phone?<br>
      Do you know how to just vibe, and just get in the zone?<br>

      Yo what that mind do?<br>
      I'm for real.<br>
      Cause when I talk to you I want you to feel what I feel.<br>
      Understand me clearly and get in sync with the vibrations from my lips.<br>
      When I speak to you.<br>
      Pay attention, can you pay attention?<br>
      Cause you might just mess around and misinterpret all of my true intentions.<br>

      So what that mind do?<br>
      What's your attention span like?<br>
      Can I turn you on to some poetry?<br>
      Can you pick my words apart when you listen to me?<br>
      Or do I have to repeat myself multiple times<br>
      for you to hear what's on my mind?<br>

      <h3>"..."</h3>

      Sorry about my perception on communication.<br>
      My jealousy and misunderstanding.<br>
      My emotions I sometimes can't manage.<br>
      My heart that's only patched with a bandage.<br>
      That hasn't fully healed,<br>
      but it's still filled with love.<br>
      Would you really give it up?<br>
      Why not just work it out?<br>
      All I need now is your touch.<br>
      I wear my heart on my sleeve and I'm not afraid to tell you how I feel.<br>
      So I pour my heart out endlessly and still don't know how you feel.<br>
      Meanwhile I'm head over hills.<br>
      Thinking about you in some heels,<br>
      and that's it.<br>
      You say you love me and then you leave me and I'm like, that's it?<br>
      You want to be with me, but instead of working it out you call it quits.<br>
      I want to be with you, but you tell me to go be with that other bitch.<br>
      Girl you got baggage.<br>
      Sometimes I can be a savage,<br>
      but I'm selfless and I'm passionate.<br>
      I got problems with moving on,<br>
      and I hate sleeping alone.<br>
      I apologize a lot because I mess up a lot.<br>
      Sometimes I'm extra extra.<br>
      Yes, I know I messed up.<br>
      How I tell you that I trust you then go question your love?<br>
      Maybe you're bad for me.<br>
      Maybe I'm bad for you.<br>
      Skip all that extra stuff, cause ain't nobody bad as you.<br>
      I love that crazy attitude.<br>
      I hate that crazy attitude.<br>
      I hate when you make me upset cause I can't stay mad at you.<br>
      I love you damn it girl.<br>
      Stop breaking my fucking heart.<br>
      Wish I was there so you could see how I feel.<br>
      Look me in my eyes, kiss me on my lips.<br>
      Know that this is real.<br>
      I'm sorry. I just don't know what else to do.<br>
      You got a wood and brick wall. I don't know how to get to you.<br>
      I feel so damn useless.<br>
      I just... I don't know.<br>

      <h3>"Stripes"</h3>

      A tiger doesn't change his stripes. That's my time after time excuse.<br>
      After my misuse and abuse.<br>
      After hurting you and you.<br>
      After feeling pain and regret,<br>
      and getting stress off my chest.<br>
      After fighting the enemy when the enemy is myself.<br>
      <br>
      After consuming ones love until there's none left.<br>
      After calling someone that. After calling someone this.<br>
      After hurting a person's feelings saying it is what it is.<br>
      When I know what I call them is what I really am.<br>
      Who I really am.<br>
      Who am I really... to judge ones actions?<br>
      It's like I do it for fun. Hurt people with a passion,<br>
      but my heart is made of gold, my mind with success.<br>
      My mouth with negativity. Wasting the time that you invest.<br>
      When you get to know me, and see I'm all charming.<br>
      Then you hate me because my flaws just surpass that grin on my face.<br>
      I smile and make you smile. One would call that contagious.<br>
      Everything I do seems to be outdated.<br>
      I'm stuck in my ways. That's me being sadistic.<br>
      I'll tell you who I am then you get mad and I don't get it.<br>
      I'm confused.<br>
      Like what I do?<br>
      You look at me like you should know.<br>
      I don't even meet new people. I just say you should go.<br>
      I can't get intimate.<br>
      I can't love one correctly.<br>
      I don't really know why. Maybe my pride won't let me.<br>
      A tiger doesn't change his strips, but see I'm a human being,<br>
      and I hate it when the people I meet try to change me.<br>
      I got the stripes of a tiger, and the heart of a lion.<br>
      With every person that enter my life. Part of me will be dying.<br>
      Because they leave, and people wonder why I am the way I am.<br>
      In reality. People act like they care, but they don't really give a damn.<br>
      <br>
      A tiger doesn't change his stripes. That's my time after time excuse.<br>
      After my misuse and abuse.<br>
      After hurting you and you.<br>
      After feeling pain and regret,<br>
      and getting stress off my chest.<br>
      After fighting the enemy when the enemy is myself.<br>

      <h3>"Letting Light Inside"</h3>
    You had me opening up my blinds,<br>
    Letting light inside.<br>
    Know how to make me smile and give me a hard time.<br>
    Know how to hide.<br>
    Emotions, feelings. Playing games. Playing hard.<br>
    You dealt the cards.<br>
    I had all hearts,<br>
    and couldn't properly play my part.<br>
    <br>
    I always invited you over,<br>
    just so we could get closer.<br>
    Even if I made you upset, you somehow still showed up.<br>
    Never could get you to open up.<br>
    I never did really know what's up.<br>
    I was hoping that I could show you love,<br>
    but I had to go and fuck that up.<br>
    Like everything else I touch.<br>
    Touching you inappropriately.<br>
    You telling me to stop, but you barely resist.<br>
    So I insist.<br>
    That I keep going, I don't even know my own intentions.<br>
    You playing games, I guess I am too. No, I don't wanna play the victim.<br>
    No, I don't want to play innocent.<br>
    Just really tryna get intimate.<br>
    You know, take a long walk?<br>
    Meet you by the reflection pool.<br>
    Reflect a thing a two.<br>
    Get next to you.<br>
    Create something incredible.<br>
    Cause, you see ...<br>
    <br>
    You had me opening up my blinds,<br>
    Letting light inside.<br>
    Know how to make me smile and give me a hard time.<br>
    Know how to hide.<br>
    Emotions, feelings. Playing games. Playing hard.<br>
    You dealt the cards.<br>
    I had all hearts,<br>
    and couldn't properly play my part.<br>
    <br>
    You entered my room,<br>
    setting the mood.<br>
    From dark to light.<br>
    Talking about, you can do that to my life.<br>
    Yeah, yeah. I hear you. Sure you're right.<br>
    Oh and again, I'm sorry about that night.<br>
    You know that night I wasn't sober,<br>
    and you came over.<br>
    Liquid courage had the best of me. I wish that I was sober.<br>
    Cause previously I had thought that, if I ever kissed you.<br>
    Or ever get wit you.<br>
    It would be more than drunk sex,<br>
    and you was over your ex,<br>
    and we had built some sort of bond.<br>
    Now you won't even hit my line.<br>
    Don't know how to act when I see you,<br>
    and it's sucks cause you're your normal self.<br>
    I just play it cool. Um, I guess I am being myself.<br>
    I want to hug you.<br>
    I wouldn't mind if we could cuddle.<br>
    I don't like it, but it's cold outside and get dark quick.<br>
    It's colder inside, and it's even darker in here.<br>
    Cause I no longer open up my blinds,<br>
    to let the light inside.<br>
    Because it was you ... that had me.<br>
    <br>
    You had me opening up my blinds,<br>
    Letting light inside.<br>
    Know how to make me smile and give me a hard time.<br>
    Know how to hide.<br>
    Emotions, feelings. Playing games. Playing hard.<br>
    You dealt the cards.<br>

      <h3>"No Pressure"</h3>
      I just want you to spend all day in the mirror tryna get perfect for me.<br>
      Only for me to say you're perfect just the way you are.<br>
      Beautiful without makeup.<br>
      I only care what's in your heart.<br>
      I care about your well being and your moods throughout the day.<br>
      My only goal with you is to keep a smile up on your face.<br>
      Make you happy when you sad.<br>
      Pick you up when you down.<br>
      The only person that I want to see when I come in town.<br>
      Make me smile when I frown.<br>
      Want you to be there for me when nobody else is around.<br>
      I just want you to remind me about that daily gallon of water that I need.<br>
      Just for me to tell you hush cause you're the only thing I need.<br>
      When they ask “who that” I want to proudly say that's all me.<br>
      Aight? But there's more things I wanna do for you, like ...<br>
      <br>
      Get you butter pecan icecream, and lick it off your nose.<br>
      Buy you a Rose.<br>
      I've never done it, but kiss you under the mistletoe.<br>
      I'm so romantic.<br>
      Even though I just wanna smack ya ass and make you smile.<br>
      Treat you like a queen, and take you out.<br>
      Ease your mind with back massages.<br>
      Always pick up, don't care what the time is.<br>
      Feed you fruit, and listen to the stories about your day.<br>
      Feed you the truth, and be the one to take away all of your pain.<br>
      Make you wanna love again.<br>
      'Cause I wanna love again.<br>
      Despite the fact, that you have let me down time and time again.<br>
      Just really wanna let you in,<br>
      but I want you to let me in as well.<br>
      Tell me about your fairytales.<br>
      Trust me with your heart and insecurities.<br>
      Let me hold the lock and give you some security.<br>
      <br>
      I'm tripping. Woman you don't deserve me.<br>
      I could be the best thing that ever happen to you,<br>
      but you don't care, you'll beat my heart until it's black and blue.<br>
      Until I lose myself over you.<br>
      Knowing I'll be the best damn fool.<br>
      Knowing I'll let you put your hands in my pocket,<br>
      take my wallet.<br>
      Rip my heart out it's socket.<br>
      Break it and then you'll take off like a rocket,<br>
      and give your love to someone who don't deserve it.<br>
      You ain't perfect,<br>
      but I can't help but see through all the imperfections.<br>
      Promise your body is a blessing,<br>
      and I still haven't learned my lesson.<br>
      Thinking I'm supposed to teach you something.<br>
      I just want to keep you coming.<br>
      Back for more,<br>
      back to back.<br>
      Never laying in the bed back to back.<br>
      Now I'm just rambling.<br>
      <br>
      Look listen. All I wanna do is take my time with you.<br>
      Be the only one that's getting all of your attention.<br>
      The only one that you respond to in an instant.<br>
      The only one you put other people on hold for.<br>
      Besides your parents, but I ...<br>
      Wanna love you, before the both of our hearts get any colder.<br>
      Get closer.<br>
      Show you that it's okay to open up.<br>
      Show you love.<br>
      That you've never seen, know you've been hurt before.<br>
      That's okay because I'm here for you.<br>
      Wanna be there for you.<br>
      Don't shut me out.<br>
      Don't let me down.<br>
      Keep me around.<br>
      Don't play no games.<br>
      Don't lie to me.<br>
      Might get more than a promise ring.<br>
      But there's no pressure.<br>
      There's no pressure.<br>
      No pressure.<br>
      Pressure.<br>

      <h3>"Golden"</h3>

      Blinded by her soul, blinded by her glow.<br>
      The most beautiful homo sapiens that I have laid my eyes on.<br>
      That I have ever known.<br>
      Staring at her feeling kind of creepy,<br>
      but I'm admiring every inch of chocolate spreading throughout her skin.<br>
      One sexy melanin.<br>
      I'm just trying to be the wrapper to that chocolate.<br>
      Hoping these words melt her heart, hoping these words make her smile.<br>
      Because I know she's heard a lot of words that have already let her down.<br>
      I like them just the way they are, but you can arch your eyebrows.<br>
      Can pull off anything, don't give a damn about what's the hairstyle.<br>
      Straight, curly, puffy or short.<br>
      Long, dyed, fake or hers.<br>
      She doesn't need lipstick,<br>
      to make me want her full lips,<br>
      on mine, oh my.<br>
      Let's not forget about that smile.<br>
      That perfect smile that brings joy to my eyes when I see it.<br>
      Perfect skin tone, sexy legs.<br>
      Especially when they're wet.<br>
      Looking beautiful with no makeup on and laying in the bed.<br>
      I get chills every time I think of kissing on her neck,<br>
      and making up for lost time.<br>
      Making her feel just how she looks.<br>
      Beautiful, special. Just know she's one of kind.<br>
      Thick thighs, beautiful eyes,<br>
      and a beautiful mind.<br>
      Not silver, but she's golden on the out and inside.<br>
      Just like her love that I took for granted.<br>
      Leaving me oh so damaged,<br>
      but she's the sweetest thing I've ever known.<br>
      Just want to kiss her collarbone,<br>
      and make that lovely skin glow<br>
      brighter than what it already is,<br>
      but I'm the Ex-Factor for a reason.<br>
      Doesn't change the way I view that beauty on you.<br>
      Shouldn't change yours either.<br>
      Strong beautiful black woman.<br>
      Sexy and sophisticated.<br>
      Your friends probably come and go because you're gorgeous and they hate it.<br>
      Woman you are golden, when you're done reading this ... say it.<br>
